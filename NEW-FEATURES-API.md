## üîß Business Logic

### Post Freezing Logic
- **Trigger**: When a post receives 5 or more reports
- **Action**: Post is automatically frozen and marked as `is_frozen: true`
- **Status**: Post status changes to `frozen`
- **Notification**: Post owner receives notification
- **Feed**: Frozen posts are excluded from all feeds

### Featured Posts Logic
- **Eligibility**: Only approved, non-frozen posts can be featured
- **Duration**: Featured posts can have expiration dates
- **Priority**: Featured posts appear first in feeds
- **Notification**: Post owner is notified when their post is featured

### User Preferences Logic
- **Tracking**: User interactions with posts are tracked
- **Scoring**: Different interaction types have different weights:
  - View: 0.1 points
  - Like: 0.3 points
  - Comment: 0.5 points
  - Share: 0.7 points
- **Recommendations**: Posts from preferred categories are prioritized
